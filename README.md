- 👋 Hi, I’m @HackersJourney but I started this journey as @dragonflies4utoo & @awesomefaith20 ... I'm not familiar enough with GitHub to bring all the previous files over to this account but I have attempted to clarify these accounts into @HackersJourney
- 👀 I’m interested in learning IOS because my ipad & iphone either has visitors that acess files remotely or I've been hacked.
- I'm hoping to meet some IT Gurus that can give me some answers or point me in the right direction. This is INSANITY not know who, what, when or why. I'm open to insight, collaboration, just anything that might solve some of the mystery files & photos that show up on my devices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and I'm working with files in Working Copy and of course GitHub. I usually run Beta if its available and i'm signed up as a Google developer. I know these programs express that we accept whatever Apple or Google throws our way! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming files that I have acquired as well as some photos. I'm available as well to help anyone else if I have the knowledge to do so!
- 📫 You may reach me @ leeanncoleman72@gmail.com or +1-380-245-6803

<---Oᗰᘜ some sanity would be amazing!---
HackersJourney/HackersJourney is a ✨ special ✨ repository to me because I'm thinking this is my last Hoo Rah to finding some answers--->
